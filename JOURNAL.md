## 10/5/2025 - Finished Schematic for my buisness card!  

I created a schematic for my business card which includes a led and a antennae with a capacitor and resistor. I learned that EasyEDA it is easier to connect to JLCPCB but I can also search to find my own parts. The schematic is wired up and so the next step is to make PCB.
